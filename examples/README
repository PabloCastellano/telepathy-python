These examples all take as their first parameter a file which contains account
details. An account file contains a set of key/value pairs, where the key and
the value are separated by a colon and a space.

The keys "manager" and "protocol" must be present. Other values are passed to
RequestConnection().

Example:

manager: gabble
protocol: jabber
account: foo@bar.com
password: s3kr1t
server: bar.com
port: 5223
old-ssl: true
ignore-ssl-errors: true
