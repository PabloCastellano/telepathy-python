Specification Todo
------------------

clarify:
why presence states have both strings and numbers
behaviour of RemoveStatus
definition of contact identifiers (getcontactcapabilities)
when presence signals will be emitted vs when to use requestpresence
listchannels is for existing channels, not types

make enum strings into numbers where appropriate


ponder:
sending messages when adding people to your contact list?
handling conference server for jabber chats
number of people in rooms when listing
destination for JUD searches
handling moderated/invite only channels?
how do you map people in chats to real identifiers if they're different?
should privacy modes be discoverable/settable offline?
how do you specify the server and your nickname when joining a chat?

later:
password changing interface
moderated channels?
buddy list groups
typing notification
submitting vcards
sketching/drawing
buddy icons
