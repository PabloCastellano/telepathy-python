Specification Todo
------------------

ponder:
sending messages when adding/removing people from a group channel
specifying the conference server for listing jabber chats
destination for JUD searches
should privacy modes be discoverable/settable offline?
how do you specify the server and your nickname when joining a chat?
moderated channels?

later:
password changing interface
buddy list groups
typing notification
submitting vcards
sketching/drawing
buddy icons
mail notification
