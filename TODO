spec essential:
draw sequence diagrams
capabilities!
connection.interface.rename
for group, check ability to add/remove in advance
pending local/pending remote
***error handling***

important:
list channels (invite only?)
passworded channels
account registration interface
user info interface
searching for users

less important:
password changing interface
moderated channels?
GROUPS

need to do at some point soon:
fix cheddar in light of massive spec changes
hook roster up to list channels
make channel object names fall under the connection in the object tree
refactor server base classes into manager/connection/channel files
registration of channel handlers to mission control
user id canonicalisation method
mapping people in chats to real identifiers
jabber conferences

nice to have:
another connection manager
