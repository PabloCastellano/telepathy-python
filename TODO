spec essential:
draw sequence diagrams
capabilities!
rename interface?

need to do at some point soon:
***error handling***
fix cheddar in light of massive spec changes
hook roster up to list channels
make channel object names fall under the connection in the object tree
refactor server base classes into manager/connection/channel files
account registration interface
password changing interface
user info interface
registration of channel handlers to mission control
user id canonicalisation method
mapping people in chats to real identifiers

nice to have:
another connection manager
proof of concept logger
versioned interfaces

ponder:
typing notification?
editing/recieving vcards?
jabber conferences?
searching for users
