    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Interface for channels which have multiple members, and where the members
    of the channel can change during its lifetime. Your presence in the channel
    cannot be presumed by the channel's existence (for example, a channel you
    may request membership of but your request may not be granted).</p>

  <p>This interface implements three lists: a list of current members, and two
    lists of local pending and remote pending members. Contacts on the remote
    pending list have been invited to the channel, but the remote user has not
    accepted the invitation. Contacts on the local pending list have requested
    membership of the channel, but the local user of the framework must accept
    their request before they may join. A single contact should never appear on
    more than one of the three lists. The lists are empty when the channel is
    created, and the MembersChanged signal should be emitted when information
    is retrieved from the server, or changes occur.</p>

  <p>Addition of members to the channel may be requested by using AddMembers. If
    remote acknowledgement is required, use of the AddMembers method will cause
    users to appear on the remote pending list. If no acknowledgement is
    required, AddMembers will add contacts to the member list directly.  If a
    contact is awaiting authorisation on the local pending list, AddMembers
    will grant their membership request.</p>

  <p>Removal of contacts from the channel may be requested by using
    RemoveMembers.  If a contact is awaiting authorisation on the local pending
    list, RemoveMembers will refuse their membership request. If a contact is
    on the remote pending list but has not yet accepted the invitation,
    RemoveMembers will rescind the request if possible.</p>

  <p>It should not be presumed that the requester of a channel implementing this
    interface is immediately granted membership, or indeed that they are a
    member at all, unless they appear in the list. They may, for instance,
    be placed into the remote pending list until a connection has been
    established or the request acknowledged remotely.</p>

  <p>If the local user joins a Group channel whose members or other state
    cannot be discovered until the user joins (e.g. many chat room
    implementations), the connection manager should ensure that the channel
    is, as far as possible, in a consistent state before adding the local
    contact to the members set; until this happens, the local contact should
    be in the remote-pending set. For instance, if the connection manager
    queries the server to find out the initial members list for the
    channel, it should leave the local contact in the remote-pending set
    until it has finished receiving the initial members list.
  </p>

  <p>If the protocol provides no reliable way to tell whether the complete
    initial members list has been received yet, the connection manager
    should make a best-effort attempt to wait for the full list
    (in the worst case, waiting for a suitable arbitrary timeout)
    rather than requiring user interfaces to do so on its behalf.</p>
