      <p>A channel type for listing named channels available on the server. Once the
    ListRooms method is called, it emits signals for rooms present on the
    server, until you Close this channel. In some cases, it may not be possible
    to stop the deluge of information from the server. This channel should be
    closed when the room information is no longer being displayed, so that the
    room handles can be freed.</p>

    <p>This channel type may be implemented as a singleton on some protocols, so
    clients should be prepared for the eventuality that they are given a
    channel that is already in the middle of listing channels. The ListingRooms
    signal, or GetListingRooms method, can be used to check this.</p>
