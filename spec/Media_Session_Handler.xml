        THIS METHOD IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED. Instead the Error
        function should be used on the relevant MediaStreamHandler objects.
        Informs the connection manager that an error occured in this session.
        If used, the connection manager must terminate the session and all of
        the streams within it, and may also emit a StreamError signal on the
        channel for each stream within the session.
