D-Bus Version
-------------
Currently you need D-Bus from CVS HEAD, for new features and bug fixes to the
Python bindings. These patches should be included in version 0.51, and
snapshots and .debs for Ubuntu Breezy are available here:
 http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/dbus

Specification
-------------
Type 'make' in the doc/ directory to generate a spec.html with the latest
version of the D-Bus interface specification, from the base classes in
telepathy/.

Server Base Classes
-------------------
telepathy/server/ implements base classes and mixins for implementing all of
the D-Bus interfaces in Telepathy. Many methods are abstract and they are
intended to be overridden in mixins for the concrete implementations, but some
perform housekeeping for you and maintain structures with some of the state
necessary to answer Get* calls. The API for implementing managers needs some
fixing really.

Swiss
-----
swiss.py is the pyxmpp-based connection manager. Currently, you should copy
swiss.manager into ~/.telepathy/ so the client can discover it, but it needs to
be executed manually.

Client Library
--------------
The client lib in telepathy/client/ isn't quite factored into a library yet,
but test-client.py can read .manager files in ~/.telepathy/ and prompt you
for the parameters for connecting. Beyond that, the code needs to be
manually fiddled depending on what you're trying to do.
