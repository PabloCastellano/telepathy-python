You need the latest D-Bus python bindings from:
 http://projects.collabora.co.uk/darcs/telepathy/dbus
These include a large number of new features and bug fixes which will be
heading in to CVS HEAD soon.

server/connmgr.py implements base classes for all of the d-bus interfaces in
Telepathy. Most methods abstract and they are intended to be used as mixins for
the concrete implementations, but some perform housekeeping for you and
maintain structures with some of the state necessary to answer Get* calls.

cheddar.py is the embryonic XMPP connection manager implementation, which
should soon implement a fair amount of the spec, but is currently broken.

The client lib in client/ isn't factored into a library yet, and needs to
access files such as cheddar.manager which must be in /usr/share/telepathy or
~/.telepathy in order to discover the connection managers which will be
activated with D-Bus service activation.

To generate documentation for D-Bus interfaces, run:
 ./doc-generator.py telepathy.server order > spec.html
