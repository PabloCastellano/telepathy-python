class Connection(dbus.service.Object):
    """
    This models a connection to a single user account on a communication
    service. Its basic capability is to provide the facility to request and
    receive channels of differing types (such as text channels or streaming
    media channels) which are used to carry out further communication.

    As well as the methods and signatures below, arbitrary interfaces may be
    provided by the Connection object to represent extra connection-wide
    functionality, such as the Connection.Interface.Presence for receiving and
    reporting presence information, and Connection.Interface.Aliasing for
    connections where contacts may set and change an alias for themselves.
    These interfaces can be discovered using GetInterfaces after the
    connection, has been established and must not change subsequently at
    runtime.

    Contacts, rooms, and server-stored lists (such as subscribed contacts,
    block lists, or allow lists) on a service are all represented by
    immutable handles, which are unsigned non-zero integers which are valid
    only for the lifetime of the connection object, and are used throughout the
    protocol where these entities are represented, allowing simple testing of
    equality within clients. Connection manager implementations should
    reference count these handles to determine if they are in use either by any
    active clients or any open channels, and may deallocate them when this
    ceases to be true. Clients may request handles of a given type and name
    with the RequestHandles method, inspect the entity name of handles
    with the InspectHandles method, keep handles from being released with
    HoldHandles, and notify that they are no longer storing handles with
    ReleaseHandles.

    Capabilities can pertain to a certain contact handle, representing

class ConnectionInterfacePresence(dbus.service.Interface):
    """
    This interface is for services which have a concept of presence which can
    be published for yourself and monitored on your contacts. Telepathy's
    definition of presence based on that used by the Galago project
    (see http://www.galago-project.org/).

    Presence on an individual (yourself or one of your contacts) is modelled as
    an last activity time along with a set of zero or more statuses, each of
    which may have arbitrary key/value parameters. Valid statuses are defined
    per connection, and a list of them can be obtained with the GetStatuses
    method.

    Each status has an arbitrary string identifier which should have an agreed
    meaning between the connection manager and any client which is expected to
    make use of it. The following well-known values (in common with those in
    Galago) should be used where possible to allow clients to identify common
    choices:
    - available
    - away
    - brb (Be Right Back)
    - busy
    - dnd (Do Not Disturb),
    - xa (Extended Away)
    - hidden (aka Invisible)
    - offline

    As well as these well-known status identifiers, every status also has a
    numerical type value which can be used by the client to classify even
    unknown statuses into different fundamental types:
    1 - CONNECTION_PRESENCE_TYPE_OFFLINE
    2 - CONNECTION_PRESENCE_TYPE_AVAILABLE
    3 - CONNECTION_PRESENCE_TYPE_AWAY
    4 - CONNECTION_PRESENCE_TYPE_EXTENDED_AWAY
    5 - CONNECTION_PRESENCE_TYPE_HIDDEN

    These numerical types exist so that even if a client does not understand
    the string identifier being used, and hence cannot present the presence to
    the user to set on themselves, it may display an approximation of the
    presence if it is set on a contact.

    The dictionary of variant types allows the connection manager to exchange
    further protocol-specific information with the client. It is recommended
    that the string (s) argument 'message' be interpreted as an optional
    message which can be associated with a presence status.

    If the connection has a 'subscribe' contact list, PresenceUpdate signals
    should be emitted to indicate changes of contacts on this list, and should
    also be emitted for changes in your own presence. Depending on the
    protocol, the signal may also be emitted for others such as people with
    whom you are communicating, and any user interface should be updated
    accordingly.

    On some protocols, RequestPresence may only succeed on contacts on your
    'subscribe' list, and other contacts will cause a PermissionDenied error.
    On protocols where there is no 'subscribe' list, and RequestPresence
    succeeds, a client may poll the server intermittently to update any display
    of presence information.
