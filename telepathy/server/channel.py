class Channel(dbus.service.Object):
    """
    All communication in the Telepathy framework is carried out via channel
    objects which are created and managed by connections. This interface must
    be implemented by all channel objects, along with one single channel type,
    such as Channel.Type.ContactList which represents a list of people (such
    as a buddy list) or a Channel.Type.Text which represents a channel over
    which textual messages are sent and received.

    Each channel may have an immutable handle associated with it, which may
    be any handle type, such as a contact, room or list handle, indicating
    that the channel is for communicating with that handle. If a channel does
    not have a handle, it means that the channel is defined by some other
    terms, such as it may be a transient group defined only by its members
    as visible through the Channel.Interface.Group interface.

    Other optional interfaces can be implemented to indicate other available
    functionality, such as Channel.Interface.Group if the channel contains
    a number of contacts, Channel.Interface.Password to indicate
    that a channel may have a password set to require entry, and
    Properties for extra data about channels which represent chat
    rooms or voice calls. The interfaces implemented may not vary after the
    channel's creation has been signalled to the bus (with the connection's
    NewChannel signal).

    Specific connection manager implementations may implement channel types and
    interfaces which are not contained within this specification in order to
    support further functionality. To aid interoperability between client and
    connection manager implementations, the interfaces specified here should be
    used wherever applicable, and new interfaces made protocol-independent
    wherever possible. Because of the potential for 3rd party interfaces adding
    methods or signals with conflicting names, the D-Bus interface names should
    always be used to invoke methods and bind signals.

    Interface for channels which have multiple members, and where the members

    cannot be presumed by the channel's existence (for example, a channel you
    may request membership of but your request may not be granted).

    This interface implements three lists: a list of current members, and two
    lists of local pending and remote pending members. Contacts on the remote
    pending list have been invited to the channel, but the remote user has not
    accepted the invitation. Contacts on the local pending list have requested
    membership of the channel, but the local user of the framework must accept
    their request before they may join. A single contact should never appear on
    more than one of the three lists. The lists are empty when the channel is
    created, and the MembersChanged signal should be emitted when information
    is retrieved from the server, or changes occur.

    Addition of members to the channel may be requested by using AddMembers. If
    remote acknowledgement is required, use of the AddMembers method will cause
    users to appear on the remote pending list. If no acknowledgement is
    required, AddMembers will add contacts to the member list directly.  If a
    contact is awaiting authorisation on the local pending list, AddMembers
    will grant their membership request.

    Removal of contacts from the channel may be requested by using
    RemoveMembers.  If a contact is awaiting authorisation on the local pending
    list, RemoveMembers will refuse their membership request. If a contact is
    on the remote pending list but has not yet accepted the invitation,
    RemoveMembers will rescind the request if possible.

    It should not be presumed that the requester of a channel implementing this
    interface is immediately granted membership, or indeed that they are a
    member at all, unless they appear in the list. They may, for instance,
    be placed into the remote pending list until a connection has been
